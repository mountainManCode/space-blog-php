  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.

    For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the   experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.
